# legv8-disassembler
This is my last project from the class COMS 321 in ISU. It translates Legv8 instructions from Binary to an Assembly representation

To Execute the code, type in the command line `sh scripts/build.sh && sh scripts/run.sh <file>`. Where `<file>` is the name of a legv8 program in binary
